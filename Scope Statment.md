# Redefining Gentrification
## Scope Statement


#### Sponsor
- The community 

#### Team Members
- Team 5: Brian Chang, Prakruti Gohel, Hector Fonseca #fabfive

#### Version/s
- 1.0
#### Project Objective Statement
- Create a data set consisting of low-cost housing sales in urban communities across the United States.
#### Project Background
- To predict the cost to revamp a given urban neighborhood across the U.S.
#### Customers
- Urban communities
#### Successful Completion Criteria
- Providing each community with the financial cost of redeveloping from within and preventing gentrification by big businesses.
#### Project Deliverables
- Community owned communities.  
#### Out of Scope
- This is not an app for low income housing sales.
### Constraints
- Limitations
- Inaccurate data (such as actual the price houses were sold in a neighborhood)


### Project Core Team Members & Roles
- Team member roles
    - Cleaning data

    - Documentation (including slides) - everyone 

### Risks
 - Uncertain events that may happen during the project
    - Supply chain issues and increase of materials.  
    - Housing market tanks.

### Future Enhancements/MVP
- Create a DAO with voting capabilities and sale of tokens that will allow people to buy in and reap the benefits from homes sold within their community.  Redefine the gentrification process and no longer displacing families in their own communities.
