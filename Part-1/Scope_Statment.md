    Create a data set consisting of low-cost housing sales in urban communities across the United States.

## Project Background
    To predict the cost to revamp a given urban neighborhood across the U.S.

## Customers
    Urban communities

## Successful Completion Criteria
    Providing each community with the financial cost of redeveloping from within and preventing gentrification by big businesses.

## Project Deliverables
    Community owned communities.  

## Out of Scope
    This is not an app for low income housing sales.

## Constraints
    Inaccurate data (such as actual the price houses were sold in a neighborhood)

## Project Core Team Members & Roles
    Cleaning data
    Pulling data
    Creating Hvplots
    Documentation (including slides) - everyone 

## Risks
    Supply chain issues and increase of materials.  Housing market tanks.

## Future Enhancements/MVP 
    WEDDING CAKEâ€“ Create a DAO with voting capabilities and sale of tokens that will allow people to buy in and reap the benefits from homes sold within their community.  Redefine the gentrification process and no longer displacing families in their own communities.
